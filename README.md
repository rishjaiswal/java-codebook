# Master Repository for DataStructure and Coding Questions

## Array

- Array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data
- JDK 1.5 introduced a new for loop known as foreach loop or enhanced for loop, which enables you to traverse the complete array sequentially without using an index variable.

## Tree

- Tree data structure comprises of nodes connected in a particular arrangement and they (particularly binary trees) make search operations on the data items easy. 
- The tree data structures consists of a root node which is further divided into various child nodes and so on. The number of levels of the tree is also called height of the tree.

## Stack

- The stack follows a “LIFO” technique for storing and retrieving elements. 
- The element which is stored at the end will be the first one to be retrieved from the stack. 
- The stack has the following primary functions:
Push(): To insert an element in the stack.
Pop(): To remove an element from the stack.

## Queue

- The queue follows a “FIFO” technique for storing and retrieving elements.
- It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to insert elements at the end of the list and deleting elements from the start of the list.
- The queue has the following primary functions :
  add() : To add an element in queue
  remove() : To remove an element from queue


## Recursion

- The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function

## LinkedList

- A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
- The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

## String 

- The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class.
- Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared.

## BackTracking

- Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time 

## Dynamic Programming.

- A Dynamic programming a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
