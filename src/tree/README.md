# Data structure - Tree.

A tree is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges.

Here is an example:

A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Here is an example of binary Tree :

- Understand the concept of a tree and a binary tree;
- Be familiar with different traversal methods;
- Use recursion to solve binary-tree-related problems;
