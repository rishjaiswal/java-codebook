/**
 * Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
 * Output: [-1,3,-1]
 * Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
 * - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 * - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
 * - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
