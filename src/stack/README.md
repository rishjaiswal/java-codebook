# Stack

A stack is a simple data structure used for storing data (similar to Linked Lists). In a stack, the
order in which the data arrives is important. A pile of plates in a cafeteria is a good example of a
stack.

A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called
top. The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called the Last in First out
(LIFO).
