# BackTracking.

- Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time 

Please refer below example of backtracking :

- Backtracking can be applied only for problems that admit the concept of a “partial candidate solution” and a relatively quick test of whether it can be completed to a valid solution. 
- Backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all candidates since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test.
