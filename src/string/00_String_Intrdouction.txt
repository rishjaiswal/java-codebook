## Strings :
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters.
In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.

The Java platform provides the String class to create manipulate strings.

The most direct way to create a string is to write âˆ’
String greeting = "Hello world!";

public class StringDemo {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
      String helloString = new String(helloArray);
      System.out.println( helloString );


      String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
      int len = palindrome.length();
      System.out.println( "String Length is : " + len );

   }
}

## ConcateningStrings :
string1.concat(string2);


## String Buffer and String Builder :
The StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used when there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to
Strings of characters.

Unlike Strings, objects of type StringBuffer and String builder can be modified over and over again without leaving
behind a lot of new unused objects.

public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      StringBuffer sBuffer = new StringBuffer("test");
      sBuffer.append(" String Buffer");
      System.out.println(sBuffer);
      sBuffer.toString();
   }
}
